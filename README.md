# DeFi AI Agent Consultant

> It Is Not A Trading Bot, It Is Your Portfolio Manager

## Product Roadmap Overview

Our ultimate mission is to enable decentralized finance applications globally, starting in regions where crypto adoption is slowed by regulation or weak infrastructure. We follow a hybrid architecture that respects local compliance while offering Web3-native features through modular design. Currently, most users rely on CeFi applications due to their simplicity, fixed fees, and integrated tools. With our AI agent, users can manage their funds as smoothly as in CeFi—while benefiting from added DeFi wallet features.

## 🌍 Focus Areas

We categorize our roadmap into two primary directions:

* **Local Market Features** – Tailored for emerging markets (e.g., Egypt, Algeria, Lebanon, and South Africa), where crypto is often viewed as a threat to fiat sovereignty. These features comply with local regulations and offer licensed, regulated access to financial tools.
* **Global Web3 Features** – A distinct track focused on DeFi-native tools such as on-chain credit, AMMs, DAOs, and yield aggregators.
