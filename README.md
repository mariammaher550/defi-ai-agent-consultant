## Product Roadmap Overview

Our ultimate mission is to enable decentralized finance applications globally, starting in regions where crypto adoption is slowed by regulation or weak infrastructure. We follow a hybrid architecture that respects local compliance while offering Web3-native features through modular design. Currently, most users rely on CeFi applications due to their simplicity, fixed fees, and integrated tools. With our AI agent, users can manage their funds as smoothly as in CeFi—while benefiting from added DeFi wallet features.

## 🌍 Focus Areas

We categorize our roadmap into two primary directions:

* **Local Market Features** – Tailored for emerging markets (e.g., Egypt, Algeria, Lebanon, and South Africa), where crypto is often viewed as a threat to fiat sovereignty. These features comply with local regulations and offer licensed, regulated access to financial tools.
* **Global Web3 Features** – A distinct track focused on DeFi-native tools such as on-chain credit, AMMs, DAOs, and yield aggregators.

## 🇪🇬 Local Market Features

### 💰 Regulated Coin Infrastructure

Our Regulated Coin system is a programmable fiat wrapper enabling seamless fiat inflows and outflows. We manage:

* Fiat custody via licensed partners
* On-chain minting/burning
* Real-time KYC/AML compliance
* Transaction approval through our Rules Engine

### ⚙️ Dynamic Rules Engine

Each on-chain action is processed through a modular Rules Engine featuring:

* **Stock Broker Module** – Enforces investor registration and KYC
* **E-Commerce Module** – Applies tax policies and regional restrictions
* **Banking Module** – Implements AML checks and enforces withdrawal limits

### 🌟 Key Benefits

* Real-Time Settlement
* DeFi-Like UX
* Interoperability
* Regulatory Protection
* Compliant by Design
* No Backend Ops Required
* Custom Rules Per App Type
* Full Regulated Coin Lifecycle Support

## 📦 Funds Orderbook

Tokenized access to local investment funds via NFT certificates enables:

* Instant liquidity through NFT-backed loans
* Yield delegation
* Secondary market participation

### 🌟 Key Benefits

* Programmable Financial Products
* On-Chain Compliance
* Streamlined Settlement
* Zero Fees

## 🌍 Global Market Features

* Non-Custodial
* Automated Cross-Chain DeFi (e.g., arbitrage, higher-yield products)
* Integration with DeFi protocols across chains
* Fiat Gateway Optimization
* Multiple Wallet Management
* On-Chain Performance Monitoring
* NFT Collector Intelligence
