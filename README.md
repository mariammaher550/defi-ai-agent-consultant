# DeFi AI Agent Consultant

> It Is Not A Trading Bot, It Is Your Portfolio Manager

## Product Roadmap Overview

Our ultimate mission is to enable decentralised finance applications anywhere, starting in regions where crypto adoption is slowed by regulation or weak infrastructure. We pursue a hybrid architecture that respects local compliance while offering Web3-native features through modular design.

## 🌍 Focus Areas

We categorise our roadmap into two primary directions:

- **Local Market Features** – Tailored for emerging markets (like Egypt, Algeria, Lebanon, and South Africa) where crypto is often treated as a threat to fiat sovereignty. These features comply with local regulations and provide licensed, regulated access to financial tools.
- **Global Web3 Features** – A separate track focused on DeFi-native tools, like on-chain credit, AMMs, DAOs, and yield aggregators.

### 💰 Regulated Coin Infrastructure

Our Regulated Coin system is a programmable fiat wrapper for seamless fiat inflows and outflows management. We handle:
- Fiat custody through licensed partners
- On-chain minting/burning
- Real-time KYC/AML compliance

### ⚙️ Dynamic Rules Engine

Every on-chain action passes through a modular Rules Engine with modules for:
- **Stock Broker Module**: Enforces investor registration and KYC
